# Script-Based Caliber Conversions
 By taking advantage of an engine oversight regarding checking if valid upgrades belong to the weapon they are being added to, this mod allows you to craft conversion kits that will allow you to rechamber your weapon. No deep-copies needed!

**NOTE: Non-GAMMA users will not be fully supported**

**Requirements for all users:**
- Modded EXEs (unlocalize + DLTX)
- Weapon Parts Overhaul (for crafting)
- Boomsticks and Sharpsticks - BaS (for BaS conversions)
- Streamlined Upgrades (for crafting)

**Incompatibilities:**
- Mags Redux - I do not have the time to patch every single conversion for this mod as it would need to be extensive, but anyone willing to tackle that monumental challenge is free to do so

This takes advantage of the Modded Exes "unlocalizer" to ensure WPO doesn't keep spitting a message about "not a valid part", as well as utilizing DLTX. This also utilizes BaS as this was made for GAMMA without Mags Redux.
